# Friday Tutorial Project Rules

## Code Base Architecture
The project currently has a minimal structure:
- Root directory contains only README.md
- No source code files or subdirectories yet

## Development Guidelines

### Project Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. No additional setup required at this time

### Code Organization
As the project grows, follow these guidelines:
- Source code should be placed in a `src/` directory
- Tests should be placed in a `tests/` directory
- Documentation should be placed in a `docs/` directory

## Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests
No testing framework is currently implemented.

When tests are added:
1. Use a standard testing framework appropriate for the project language
2. Run tests with the framework's standard command
3. Ensure all tests pass before committing changes

## Linting Guidelines

No linting configuration is currently present.

When linting is added:
1. Use a standard linter appropriate for the project language
2. Run the linter before committing changes
3. Fix all linting issues or document exceptions
