# Friday Rules for Virtual Guestbook Project

## Workflow Guidelines

- Create a new branch for each guestbook entry
- Name branches with format: feature/guestbook-entry-[username]-[date]
- Ensure SVG icons are optimized and render well at all sizes
- Include a personal message with each guestbook entry
- Ensure icon names are unique
- Ask clarifying questions if the user hasn't provided a personal message or icon description

## Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new components
- Follow existing code style and formatting
- SVG icons should be created as React components in the src/icons directory
- Each icon component should accept standard props like color, size, className, and style

## Guestbook Entry Requirements

- Each entry must have a unique ID and component name
- Create a corresponding icon component in src/icons directory
- Include contributor name and date
- Personal message should be meaningful and related to your experience
- Add your new icon component to the icons/index.ts file

## Icon Generation Guidelines

- Icons should be AI-generated SVG files
- SVG dimensions should be 24x24 viewBox
- Use simple, clean designs with limited colors
- Icons should be meaningful and related to the contributor or their message
- Icons must adhere to the Content Guidelines (no inappropriate imagery)
- SVG code should be optimized and minified
- Ensure the SVG has no external dependencies
- Test that the icon renders correctly at different sizes (S, M, L, XL)
- Icons should have unique names from each other

## Content Guidelines

- All content must be appropriate for a public page with a broad audience
- No inappropriate, indecent, or unprofessional messages or icons
- No offensive, explicit, or controversial content
- No political, religious, or divisive messaging
- Icons and messages should be positive, constructive, and respectful
- Content should be suitable for all ages and professional environments

## Code Base Architecture

- Next.js TypeScript frontend at project root
  - /src/components - React components for the guestbook UI (AnimatedGuestbook, GuestbookWall, Icon)
  - /src/icons - SVG icon components contributed by users
  - /src/data - Contains guestbook.json with icon entries
  - /src/mockApi.ts - Mock API implementation for the guestbook
  - /src/setupMockApi.ts - Mock API setup using fetch interceptor
  - /pages - Next.js page components with TailwindCSS styling

## Development Setup

- `npm install && npm run dev` (runs on default Next.js port)

## Testing Guidelines

- No explicit testing configuration is currently set up in the project
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) is used for API mocking
- To add tests, consider using Jest and React Testing Library with Next.js

## Linting Guidelines

- Uses ESLint with next/core-web-vitals configuration
  - Configuration in package.json under "eslintConfig"
  - Run linting with `npx eslint .`

## Build and Deployment

- Build: `npm run build`
- Start: `npm start`
